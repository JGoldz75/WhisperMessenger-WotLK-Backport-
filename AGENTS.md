# WhisperMessenger

This fork backports F0rty-Tw0's messenger-style whisper UI to the original World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich King 3.3.5a client (build 12340). `WhisperMessenger.toc` must keep `## Interface: 30300` and backslash-separated runtime paths. Keep the installed folder name `WhisperMessenger`. Upstream multi-client history and tests are retained, but this fork packages the original Wrath target only.

## Tech Stack

- **Lua 5.1** (WoW runtime) — no Lua 5.2+ features (no `goto`, no `table.unpack` without compat)
- **WoW API** — Blizzard's frame/widget system, C\_ namespaced APIs
- **Flavor differences** go through `Core/FlavorCompat.lua` and the private `Core/LegacyWrath/` adapters — never assume a Retail-only API exists or replace another addon's global compatibility provider
- **StyLua** — formatter (`stylua.toml`)
- **Luacheck** — static analysis (`.luacheckrc`)

## Code Conventions

- **2-space indentation, spaces** (not tabs)
- **PascalCase** for modules/classes: `ConversationStore`, `TableUtils`
- **camelCase** for functions/variables: `buildContacts`, `refreshWindow`
- **snake_case** for theme constants: `bg_primary`, `text_secondary`
- **Module pattern**: every file starts with `local addonName, ns = ...` plus the `if type(ns) ~= "table" then ns = {} end` guard, and ends with `ns.ModuleName = ModuleName; return ModuleName`
- **Prefix unused args with `_`**: `_self`, `_event`, `_conversation`
- **Access WoW globals via `_G.`**: `_G.CreateFrame`, `_G.C_ChatInfo` — keeps the dependency on globals explicit and testable

## Linting

```bash
# Check (CI-safe) — always use the project script, not bare tool commands
bash scripts/lint.sh

# Auto-format + check
bash scripts/lint.sh --fix
```

Luacheck handles semantics (unused vars, undefined globals, shadowing). StyLua handles formatting (line length, spacing, alignment). Both must pass clean before committing — they are the only lint gates CI runs.

`lint.sh` also runs LuaLS diagnostics, which already report ~300 old problems, so the script exits 1 even on a clean tree. Don't add new LuaLS problems: compare the count against a stash of your changes.

Missing tools on Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/setup-lint-tools.ps1` installs them into `.tools/`.

When adding new WoW API globals, add them to `.luacheckrc` under `read_globals`.

## Tests

```bash
# If lua is available:
lua tests/run.lua tests/path/to/test_file.lua

# If lua is not available (Windows), use the Python+lupa harness (pip install lupa):
python scripts/run_test.py tests/path/to/test_file.lua
```

Tests run with plain Lua — no WoW runtime needed. WoW APIs are stubbed via `tests/helpers/fake_ui.lua` and the `tests/helpers/fake_ui/` folder. Run all tests:

```bash
python scripts/verify_wotlk.py

# Release script tests (Python):
python -m unittest tests.scripts.test_gen_patch_notes tests.scripts.test_promote_changelog
```

CI runs the complete Lua 5.1 suite and the strict original-client simulation, then builds the runtime ZIP with `scripts/package_wotlk.py`. Tests run on both Windows and Linux; normalize TOC paths only when opening files in test tooling, never in the shipped manifest. Do not add local diagnostic captures, extracted client archives, saved variables, credentials, or private paths to commits.

## Development Workflow — TDD (Red-Green-Refactor)

Every change follows test-driven development. No exceptions.

1. **Red** — Write a failing test first. The test must fail for the right reason (missing behavior, not a syntax error). Run it and confirm the failure.
2. **Green** — Write the minimum code to make the test pass. No more, no less. Run the test and confirm it passes.
3. **Refactor** — Clean up the implementation and the test. Remove duplication, improve naming, simplify logic. Run all tests to confirm nothing broke.

Rules:

- **Never write production code without a failing test that demands it.**
- **One behavior per test** — each test should verify a single expectation.
- **Test file mirrors source file** — `Model/ConversationStore.lua` → `tests/model/test_conversation_store.lua`
- **Test names describe behavior** — `test_mark_read_resets_unread_count`, not `test_mark_read_1`
- **Run the relevant test file after Red and Green steps.** Run all tests after Refactor.
- **Lint after Refactor** — run `bash scripts/lint.sh` before considering the cycle complete.

## File Size & Modularity

- **Target ~300 lines per file.** If a file grows past 300 lines, split it into focused sub-modules.
- **One responsibility per file** — a file that does two things should be two files.
- **Extract early** — when adding code would push a file over 300 lines, extract a new module before continuing.
- **Applies to both production and test files.**

## Adding a File

- **Add it to `WhisperMessenger.toc`, after everything it depends on.** TOC order is load order. WoW: Forever has a global `require` that throws "Invalid import", so a module's `ns.X or require(...)` fallback must never be reached in game. `tests/integration/test_toc_load_order.lua` guards this.
- **Folder modules** (`UI/Theme/`, `UI/Composer/`, …) have an `init.lua` that only exists so tests can `require` the folder. It is not in the TOC; add any new one to the `ignore:` list in `.pkgmeta`.
- **New top-level files that aren't addon code** (docs, configs) go in `.pkgmeta` `ignore:` so they don't ship in the zip.

## Localization

- English strings are the keys: `Localization.Text("Mark all as read")`. There is no enUS catalog.
- `Locale/<code>.lua` holds one catalog per language (10 total). Every new player-visible string needs a translation in **all** of them with the same `%s` / `%d` slots in the same order — `tests/util/test_locale_parity.lua` fails otherwise.

## Lua Best Practices

- **Localize everything** — `local` variables and functions are faster than globals. Always `local function` unless exporting on a module table.
- **Localize hot-path API calls** — `local pairs = pairs`, `local tinsert = table.insert` at the top of files that use them in loops.
- **Avoid creating tables in tight loops** — reuse tables or build outside the loop when possible. Table creation triggers GC pressure.
- **Prefer `ipairs` for arrays, `pairs` for dictionaries** — never use `pairs` on sequential arrays; iteration order is not guaranteed.
- **String concatenation** — use `table.concat` for building strings in loops. The `..` operator creates a new string each time.
- **Nil checks before method calls** — WoW frames may be nil or lack methods in test stubs. Guard with `if obj and obj.Method then` before calling.
- **No global leaks** — every variable must be `local`. Luacheck catches these, but be vigilant. The only intentional globals are WoW API calls via `_G.`.
- **Early returns over deep nesting** — prefer `if not condition then return end` at the top of a function over wrapping the whole body in an `if`.
- **Avoid magic numbers** — extract constants into `Theme.LAYOUT`, `Theme.COLORS`, or a local `UPPER_CASE` variable at the top of the file.
- **Keep functions small** — if a function exceeds ~40 lines, extract helpers. Each function should do one thing.
- **No `table.getn` or `#` on sparse tables** — `#` is only reliable on proper sequences (no nil holes).

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is **player-facing release notes**, not an engineering log. The audience is WoW players browsing this backport's GitHub page and in-game What's New — not other developers.

- **Write in plain English.** A player should understand every bullet without knowing any code, module names, or addon internals.
- **Describe the in-game effect, not the implementation.** Say what the user will now see / can now do / will no longer be broken — not which file changed, which API was introduced, which refactor happened.
- **Banned in changelog entries:** file paths, module names (`BehaviorSettings`, `WindowCoordinator`, `MessengerWindow`, etc.), function names, API names (`C_ChatInfo`, `SetCVar`, etc.), Lua terms, test names, "refactor", "introduce", "extract", "wire up", "config key", "token". If a sentence only makes sense to someone reading the diff, it doesn't belong here.
- **One bullet per user-visible change.** Group related fixes into one line if the user would see them as the same thing.
- **Fixes start with `Fixed:`.** Features and behavior changes don't need a prefix.
- **Always update `CHANGELOG.md` when behavior, UI, settings, or fixes change** — in the same turn as the code edit. Put the line under `## [Unreleased]`. Only if a version section exists that has not been tagged yet (release prep in flight), add it there instead — `scripts/release.sh` refuses to run when both hold notes.

### Layout

`CHANGELOG.md` holds only `[Unreleased]` plus the **current series** (2.0.x today). Older series live in `archive/changelog/<major>.<minor>.md` (e.g. `archive/changelog/1.4.md`).

- Every file starts with an `All releases:` nav line linking each of the other series.
- **`bash scripts/release.sh <version>` handles all of this:** it moves `[Unreleased]` into a dated `## [x.y.z]` section, archives the finished series when a new minor/major opens, rebuilds every nav line, regenerates `Core/PatchNotes.lua`, and bumps the TOC + `Constants.lua` versions. Don't hand-edit version sections or nav lines for a release.
- `scripts/package_wotlk.py` includes only runtime files and install/license/media attribution documents; `archive/`, tests, and development tools never ship in the addon ZIP.

When in doubt, read the 1.1.0 - 1.1.7 sections in `archive/changelog/1.1.md` — they are the style guide. Match their voice.

## Releasing

1. Notes sit under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`, and the working tree is clean (the script refuses otherwise).
2. `bash scripts/release.sh <version>` — promotes the notes, regenerates `Core/PatchNotes.lua` (the in-game What's New), bumps the TOC + `Core/Constants.lua`, and creates a local commit and tag. It preserves interface 30300 and does not query live Blizzard versions.
3. `git push origin master v<version>` — CI tests and packages the port; the version tag publishes a GitHub Release for this fork only. Never publish this fork to the upstream project's CurseForge or Wago listings.

For a ZIP without a release, run `python scripts/package_wotlk.py`, or run the manual packaging workflow on GitHub (`workflow_dispatch`). Manual workflow runs produce a downloadable artifact without creating a release or tag.

When preparing notes without creating a release tag, run `python scripts/promote_changelog.py --version v<version>`, update the TOC and Constants versions together, and run `python scripts/gen_patch_notes.py --version v<version>`. Never hand-edit generated `Core/PatchNotes.lua`.

What's New shows only the **top** changelog section. For a hotfix right after a big release, rename the big section to the new version and add the fix to it, leaving `[Unreleased]` empty — players who skipped the big release still see all of it.
